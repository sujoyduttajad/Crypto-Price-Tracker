A Cryptocurrency Price Tracker which shows the current price for all the cryptocurrency in the world. Price is shown in USD. All the relevant details are also displayed including price, volume, coin-percentage & market capital.


This app is build with React, React-hooks like useState and useEffect and for content I used the coingecko API, fetched the data and used promises to get the request from the server.
