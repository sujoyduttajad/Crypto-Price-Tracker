# What goes into building this app
This app is build with React, React-hooks like useState and useEffect and for content I used the coingecko API, fetched the data and used promises to get the request from the server. 

# Why I build this
I build this app as cryptocurrency is booming in todays world and it's really important to monitor the real data before you start mining. The goal was to help data-miners to keep a track of the cryptocurrency prices, market cap, volumes and other parameters.

# Future Scope
Using D3.js to create a line graph or bar chart or both based on the data from the API
